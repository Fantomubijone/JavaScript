            I'm Carl Allen Torno, a 20-year-old BSIT student from FEU Institute
            of Technology specializing in Web and Mobile Applications. I aspire
            to become a Full Stack Developer, building applications that can
            make a difference in people's lives. As Walt Disney said, "Keep
            moving forward," and that's the motto I live by, constantly pushing
            myself to learn and grow in my field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding programming, Java, Python, C++, and C# are my jam, but
            Java is my absolute favorite. I love the challenge of finding
            solutions to complex problems and bringing my ideas to life through
            code. I also have experience with web technologies such as HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScriptAside from programming, I'm also a big fan of
            anime and sitcoms. I escape reality and immerse myself in different
            worlds. Even though I'm introverted to strangers, I'm always open to
            meeting new people and expanding my horizons. You can call me by my
            surname, Torno, or Torns. Let's connect and build something unique
            together.
